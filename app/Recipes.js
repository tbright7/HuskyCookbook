    story:
      "Born to a Mexican mother and a Filipino father, I grew up feeling more culturally tied to my Mexican heritage and was relatively isolated from my Filipino background. So it was a real treat when my dad cooked for the family because food was one of my only connections to a culture I knew very little about. A favorite dish that I always helped him make was lumpia, a Filipino take on a spring roll. Sitting at the table, my dad and I would stuff and roll one piece at a time, all the while listening to him recount stories about life back in his hometown, and about my grandparents, his kid summers on the farm, jeepneys, the family carabao, and playing in the river catching shrimp with his friends. For me, lumpia was not just a dish: it was something that brought me closer to my Filipino heritage and identity.",

      "01 In a large bowl, add the ground pork, carrots, celery, onion, garlic, and  ginger. Using a fork or hands, combine the ingredients until everything is  well mixed ",
      "02 Add the black pepper and two tablespoons of soy sauce. Mix well, then bring your nose close to the bowl for a “flavor-sniff-check:” the meat should smell fragrant with the soy sauce and pepper (well-seasoned), but the soy should not be overpowering (over-salted). If needed, add another tablespoon of soy sauce to the bowl and mix well. If unsure, refrain from adding more soy sauce and just use the extra for dipping later. ",
      "03 Turn on stove to medium setting. In a deep, medium-large frying pan,  heat canola oil to about 300°F. If you don’t have a thermometer, you’ll  know oil is hot when it sizzles and pops if you dip chopsticks into it. ",
      "04 While waiting for the oil to heat up, begin filling the spring roll wrappers. Take one spring roll wrapper, and set it on a dry surface in a diamond  shape. With a fork, take about 1 ½ tablespoons of mixture and evenly  spread at the bottom half of the wrapper, leaving about 2 inches of space between the mix and the bottom point. Try not to make your lumpia too fat or too skinny. Optional: with a knife, cut lumpia in half. ",
      "05 Fold the bottom point over the filling, then fold in the left and right edges to make an envelope shape. Roll the wrapper towards the top point, using  your fingers to compress the meat as you roll. ",
      "06 Right before you close up the roll, dip your finger in the water, and like  you would when sealing an envelope, wet the edges and seal the roll. ",
      "07 When your oil is hot, using tongs, add lumpia to the pan. Keep about a  half inch of space between rolls in order to ensure even cooking. Note that  if the lumpia is cooking too fast or burning, reduce heat. Fry each side for about 2 - 4 minutes, or until the wrapper starts to turn golden brown. ",
      "08 Remove from heat and place on some paper towels. Wrapper will be  drenched in oil and so will continue to cook, hence why it’s important to  remove from heat before turning golden brown. ",
      "09 Serve with rice, guisado (sauteed vegetables), and/or pansit (Filipino  stir fry noodles). Dip in sweet and sour sauce; or, mix in a small bowl some  soy sauce, white vinegar and minced serrano pepper to your taste. My dad  and I would also sometimes dip our lumpia in ketchup mixed with Tabasco  sauce… Masarap!!",

      "As a child, I was raised in a province that serves seafood-based dishes and plenty of grilled, tangy and citrusy spiced food due to my parent’s work in South Sulawesi. Eventually, after several years serving in a remote region, my parents decided they wanted to go back to their hometown. I found it hard to adjust to Javanese sweet-palm sugar or coconut-based mostly- braised cooking food. So ‘perkedel’ is one of the first batches of Javanese traditional foods that I actually liked since the food is neutral and comforting, sweet but not overwhelming, spicy but subdued, and when served along with tumpeng or tangy Soto, it reminds me so much of my childhood home- cooking. I like it so much that I learned how to cook it when I was 11. After years of cooking this recipe with different meat (you can even replace the potato with smashed fried tofu) I also realize that this food uses one of three key recipes of mix spices that are commonly shared by different ethnicities on different Indonesian islands. So although it was originally made to recreate a version of Dutch’s ‘frikadeller’, this food is versatile and every spice in a bite of perkedel will always remind me of home.",

Papa a la Huancaina is a popular Peruvian appetizer-dish, so it was made readily at many kinds of gatherings, not just Peruvian ones, but even times like Christmas or Thanksgiving! We always mixed up Peruvian cuisine along with the regular American cuisine when I was growing up. This relatively simple dish of potatoes and eggs with a rich creamy cheese and pepper sauce really exemplifies Peruvian cuisine! Not only does it have the unique aji amarillo (yellow pepper) that all Peruvians know well, but the centerpiece is the potato, which is interesting because potatoes originated in the Andes of Peru! I always know I’m among other Peruvians when I see this dish at a gathering, and it brings a sense of welcoming and familiarity to my culture.",

Every weekday, my friends and I waited in line at the school cafeteria, waiting in line to buy our $5 lunch combo, and gathering around the long benches to eat the food. No surprise, poutine was a staple dish there, and due to my long love for fries, I asked for the fries. The lady at the kitchen asked whether I wanted just fries or poutine. I was confused, “What is poutine?” The lady smiled and scooped cheese and gravy onto my fries, and asked me to try it. Ever since that, I fell in love with poutine.

Tamagoyaki is a Japanese rolled omelet that, when done well, is soft and pillowy with just the right amount of umami. The beauty of tamagoyaki is that it tastes good right off the pan or at room temperature in a bento. Having grown up in California as a half-Japanese American, I took for granted the proximity of the Japanese community and food around me there. So when I moved up to Seattle, perhaps as a way to cope with some degree of homesickness, I started making my own bentos.

      "I find myself a sense of belonging through love and devotion one puts into the making of food. I was born and raised in Burma (Myanmar), and despite living in the US for a decade whilst my family is in Burma, the hardest challenge still is not being able to enjoy my mama’s simple home-cooked meal: the sauteed water spinach with garlic. I still remember vividly how my siblings and I would fight over who got to eat the savory leaves portion of a dish or the crunchy stalks of this nutritious leafy vegetable, which sometimes naturally grew in our backyard. This simple dish makes me realize what it is like to belong in a place where you can share your favorite things and make inedible memories with your beloved ones. What’s more, my passion for cooking grows even stronger as I learn my mama’s recipes to cook and find myself a sense of home away from home.",

Flavors, colors, card games, and heated political conversations constructed the minutes and hours of this weekly ritual. It was only in my late 20’s that I realized what a special time this was and how blessed I was to have been exposed to so many diverse and delectable dishes. One that always stood out was the tahini dip --so rich and creamy, with each individual ingredient (garlic, lemon, olive oil, sea salt, parsley, sesame) visiting my taste buds and leaving a little moment of delight. Tahini is originally an Arab food adopted by Israelis (where I am from).

      "I don’t know how lefse escaped my awareness until I made a 2019 family visit to Norway to explore my distant ancestral roots. I was never especially interested in visiting Scandinavia until my 40s, but I have been very interested in cooking since I was a child. It was eye-opening to “discover” a bread from my own heritage, even when I spend quite a lot of my free time researching and testing bread recipes. For me, lefse represents how all people make incredibly delicious food with whatever they happen to have on hand. After making lefse in Norway, I came back to the US and put my personal touch on this particular recipe by making it partially whole wheat. If you don’t like this vaguely healthy improvement, please use only all-purpose flour. If you are Norwegian and you find fault with my non- traditional whole wheat approach, please send me your passport, altered such that it is now my passport. Thanks!",

      "04 Cover and rest dough for at least 30 minutes. If refrigerated, let dough warm up to room temperature for 30-45 minutes prior to the following step. ",
      "05 Weigh the dough and divide it into 10 equal pieces. Pat or roll each piece into a 10-12 inch disc on a very well-floured surface. I like to make them thin and delicate, but you can make them heftier if you already know you prefer a heftier potato-based product. I have never actually used a rolling pin to roll them. But I am sure a more patient person would. ",
      "06 While you are rolling, heat a cast iron skillet, griddle, or a non-stick frying pan. You want it heated to high (400-425°F) and entirely ungreased. I use a large pancake griddle to make the process go more quickly. ",
      "07 Dust flour off the disc as best you can--I use a pastry brush. Using your trusty bench scraper as needed and your dexterous digits, lift the dough disc from the work surface and put on the hot pan. It’s OK to push it around with your fingertips to spread it out a wee bit more at this point if you need to. It will brown in spots, quickly. ",
      "08 Flip it over and cook the other side until nicely spotty, too. Repeat this process. ",

      "10 Wait, did you ask how to consume them? Lefse can be used as a flatbread, tortilla, or some other kind of wrap. In Norway, I was told they are used to wrap hotdogs, but I think they make a nice wrap for whatever savory leftovers you have around. When I was on my trip, I used them to make grilled cheese “sandwiches” with slices of fresh zucchini in between. You can easily go super sweet with these and eat like pancakes by adding sugar, butter, and cinnamon. I also like the idea of squishing on some sweet items (Norwegian brown cheese and cloudberry jam, eh?), then roll up jelly roll style and tuck away in your backpack in anticipation of hungrier times of travel.",

      "One day I received a text from a friend asking me if I wanted to join for dinner at her friend Jane’s house. After some initial hesitation, I said yes to the prospect of the free, home-cooked meal. Seated at the dining table was my friend and two strangers on a couch way too low for the table. Jane was in the kitchen, completely unfazed by the 18 Thai chilies sizzling over oil with only a cracked window for ventilation—a Pittsburgh classic. She told me to go sit and mingle. At this point I contemplated leaving, as I had signed up for one stranger, not three. But mingle, I did. In a few minutes we were crowded around Jane in an already-cramped kitchen, cracking jokes right and left, and competing to help ‘mom’. By the time we finally cleared the chili fumes from the living room and dug into the Thai basil pork, I felt right at home in that hodgepodge family. Jane continued to invite me to these weeknight dinners with a rotating list of \"food friends\" and food better than what you could get at any restaurant in Pittsburgh. She provided a safe space for us to connect across demographic differences. The magic was in the friendships that formed between people who would never have come together without Jane. That friendship and association with Jane's cooking were so strong that when we all reunited at Jane's wedding this past summer, we introduced/re-introduced each other by our names and which of Jane's dishes we ate together.",

I created this dish during my third year of University; meanwhile, I worked out a lot and must eat chicken breast every day. The way I cooked chicken breasts at first is simple: water boil with salt and pepper. In that way the breasts taste plain and hard to chew. In my recipe, the way to cook the breasts is simple and healthy, and it gives me the most tender chicken breast that I ever had. In this case, the egg white and time of cooking are essential. Both of them combine together keep the moisture from escaping from the breast and not over cooked. I then gave the breasts a Szechuan flavor but with less calories and salt. In the traditional recipe, the chef adds sesame paste and more chili oil, which contains too much calories that are not good for a bodybuilding dish. Overall, it is a body building, Szechuan style, and tender chicken breast.",

      "My heart was pounding and felt like it would leap up out of my chest at any moment. Adrenaline coursed through my body and shook my arms so much I could barely hold my bow up straight. I had just called in my first elk, a large, bull, Roosevelt elk that was now 20 yards away from me. As I drew down on him, the rush left me – I was steady. I have always had a heartfelt passion for the outdoors and archery. Some of my favorite memories of growing up involve my dad and I shooting our bows in the backyard of our rural Wisconsin home. Unfortunately, my dad is no longer able to meet the physical demands of an elk hunt; so, to honor him and the animal, I harvested every usable piece of meat on the animal, including the heart.",

      "Every time I come across Pav Bhaji, familiar sights and smells of one of the many beaches of Mumbai come alive. I see a kid version of myself asking my parents to stop by at these Pav-Bhaji vendors at Juhu Beach. These street shops are overflowing with people who've just spent an evening at the beach with their friends and family, playing water sports and kicking the ball around, and now want to reward their tired bodies with the tastiest food this city has ever had the good fortune of claiming to its name. Pav Bhaji is an eclectic mixture of mashed potatoes, cauliflowers and bell peppers in a gravy of tomato, onion and garlic. It is then garnished with some strong Indian spices topped with butter, and consumed with bread. In many ways, this dish is representative of Mumbai's cosmopolitan culture. Mumbai is a mixture of people from across India, it is warm and friendly, and embraces everyone. Pav Bhaij's existence can be traced back to the early 1950s, when cotton mill workers would simply mix whatever vegetables they could afford, mash them all, and consume it with bread. But today, the rich and poor love it alike. No other food transcends boundaries like Pav Bhaji.",

      "Sichuan cuisine, known as Szechuan cuisine here in the west, has the Mala profile (spicy and numbing) and it is perfect for the damp climate in the Southwest region in China. Shui Zhu (means “boil”) has a broth infused with fermented bean sauce and chili peppers and is finished by pouring hot oil over minced garlic and Sichuan peppercorn. This dish brings back memories of traveling through Southwest China and it represents my hidden warm passion for food and hospitality. When I started traveling independently, Sichuan Province was where I chose to visit first. I was immediately drawn to the complexity of flavor profile in the cuisine I tasted there. When I started a cooking blog many years ago, I experimented with many authentic Chinese recipes, and this dish was one of the first few dishes that I learned and executed successfully when I first arrived in America. Making this dish (and cooking in general) was my way to compensate for the stress of nursing school, showcase authentic Chinese cooking, and comfort my parents with the fact I was learning to cook and feed myself.",

This dish is the top one on my list if I was invited to a potluck or wanted to cook something that can represent my culture. Different from western culture, pork is widely used in Chinese dishes. This dish applied some significant Chinese ingredients including crystal sugar, cooking wine, and vinegar, as well as the procedure: to coat sugar color onto the ribs. For my 6+ years in the US, this dish becomes a part of my life, and I have cooked that for most of the cultural and company events I have participated in, and everyone who tried loves it.

I remember one Saturday morning, before my first ever swim meet, my mom showed me what her mother always made her before a game day: matzah and eggs. Matzah, for those who may not know, is an unleavened “bread” that more resembles a cracker that is traditionally consumed during Passover. However, like any other self-respecting Jew, I eat the stuff darn near 24/7! With some fresh eggs collected straight from the farm, newly picked zucchini, garlic, onion, and good ol’ matzah, heaven could be attained.

It has always been my standard, but I can't find most of my mom's ingredients here.

I grew up with her and I often found myself struggling with my cultural identity. Mexico is my homeland, but growing up with so many European references made me realize that I was from “Santa-Maria-Todo-el-Mundo,” this is not from here, neither from there.

In later years, my two boys wanted the recipe for their wives! Faye was an exquisite cook i.e., she canned fresh peaches then made peach pie from scratch - oh my!

    story:
      "When I moved to the United States from south India as a teenager, I could only cook 3 dishes. While I could eat at Indian restaurants, they served mostly north Indian dishes. But I yearned for the flavors of south Indian cooking and learned to cook to stave off the nostalgia. Meen Moily is a fish stew that comes from the southern Indian state of Kerala. Meen means fish. Several stories credit this dish to Moily, a cook who made this dish for the Britishers who could not handle spicy food. I love this dish because it combines two staples of Keralan cuisine - fish and coconut - with spices typical of south India to create delicate but sophisticated flavors. It’s also easy but looks beautiful with the bright colors. So naturally, Meen Moily is one of my go-to dishes for dinner with guests or a weekend family night.",

While the core ingredients of chicken, egg, shoyu, and sugar have remained the same, each time I was taught the recipe it was never the same. My experience with Oyako-don runs parallel to my journey to uncover my cultural identity as a Japanese-American. Whether it was my host mom’s “authentic” Japanese recipe, or my mother’s, a fourth generation immigrant, Americanized recipe, I felt that oyako came to represent my family’s journey of semi-assimilation into this country.

Borscht, a traditional Slavic soup commonly known for the red color given by beets, is sometimes made with beef. However, the meat was first to go from my grandmother’s recipe because of how scarcely it was available to Soviet citizens.

      "Borsch is an ancient, sweet-sour soup which emerged from early Slavic cultures. Once made using savory herbs found in bogs and meadows, the dish has evolved into a staple of Slavic cuisine. As a Russian national, borscht is a food we often made during rainy falls and cold winters, providing rich, comforting broth, hearty veggies, and a wonderful sense of homeliness. When I was young, I adopted a vegetarian diet, and became passionate about creating plant-based versions of my favorite foods. Some dishes, like borsch, are readily found in vegetarian varieties in Russia, especially during the time period of the ‘velikii post’ - or Great Lent, a Russian Orthodox religious fast held before Easter. To me, there is nothing more quintessentially Slavic and homely than a warm bowl of soup, shared with friends and family, on a chilly autumn day.",

      "It wasn’t until I moved to Seattle that I realized how little of the Vietnamese food I’d eaten as a child had been a part of my diet during my prior 17 years living in New York City. As children, my sisters and I were raised on the culinary delights of southern China and Vietnam, owing to the fact that our grandparents had been refugees from Guangdong and would be again — along with our parents — refugees from Vietnam after the purge of ethnic of Chinese in the late 1970s. The meat-laden bánh mì kep thit sandwich and the flavors of fish sauce, lemongrass, and shrimp paste were nearly as prominent as the myriad dishes and dim sum of Cantonese cuisine that would find their way into our kid-sized bellies. Even though I had basically gone plant-based toward the tail end of the New York years, I hadn’t touched a bowl of pho or bún, or even one of the most memorable dishes of my childhood—bò kho—for nearly two decades. Bò kho, as my mother prepared it, was/is a very spicy beef stew with a not-so-subtle and yet very appealing hit of licorice-flavor from the dish’s use of star anise. I don’t remember my exact age (but likely in the single digits) when our mother first served this steaming bowl of tender beef, carrots, and Scoville units to us with a crusty French baguette, but I do remember my older sister and my sweet suffering. Sure, the heat of the chilies made us sweat as if we’d done laps around the block, and sure it seemed like there wasn’t enough water in the faucet to squelch the fires dancing on our tongues, but it didn’t stop us from taking bite after bite until the torn piece of bread sopped up the last of the dark brown broth. Nostalgic for that tasty torture, I recently set out to create a vegan version of bò kho, and the result is the following recipe, which is every bit as good as the one from my memories.",

      "Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup’s story dates to 1949, when the Nationalists retreated from mainland China to settle in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. They re- created a braised beef noodle soup, using available variants of Chinese ingredients not found in Taiwan at the time. Originally purposed as a nostalgic reminder of a lost home, Taiwanese style beef noodle soup gradually penetrated the country, and is now Taiwan’s most recognized and important national dish. Although braised beef noodle soup is widely considered a cherished treat in my native Taiwan, for me it holds an even deeper meaning. When I was a child, my father worked abroad and was unable to visit home often. When he did return, my mother cooked beef noodle soup to mark his return. Beef noodle soup meant Dad was coming home and became a symbol of reunion for our family.",

      "One summer I was looking for a good use of eggplants that could achieve authentic flavor while using no meat. For me, this has been tough to balance; I chose to avoid meat because the climate change it drives is disproportionately affecting far off world communities, but for many of those ethnically diverse communities, meat is essential to their culturally significant dishes. Using many recipes such as Khoresh Bademjan and Ghormeh Sabzi from Persian Cuisine and techniques from Lebanese Cuisine, I developed this recipe. For me, this recipe is about truly enjoying the fresh ingredients available only in summer. It has become a family favorite at my house and no doubt works for all family members. As summer comes to a close and eggplants grow to size, I await the rich smells of spice and caramelized tomato on the sides of the pot. Highly adaptable, this vegan recipe is about nailing down the spice ratio but anything can be added within reason— yogurt cools the warmth of the dish on a hot summer evening.",

On the night of June 8th, my mom and grandparents had chicken porridge for dinner at a small family-owned business in Kuching, Malaysia. Shortly after, my mom went into labor and gave birth to me. While I still insist on dining at the restaurant every time I visit Kuching, I have never been a regular patron. My dad’s job moved my family to Shanghai, China, where I grew up in an international education system. This environment exposed me to diverse cultures from young and taught me to celebrate cultural diversity, most often through food. In my elementary school, we celebrated International Day every year. Dressed up in our traditional attire, my friends and I would prance around the fair, sampling the various homemade dishes at each cultural booth. In high school, since many of my friends were American, my family and I started celebrating Thanksgiving. I still remember how excited I was to try turkey during my first Thanksgiving dinner. My mom took one look at the leftovers and said, “All this bone and meat is going to make such good porridge!” Now, I look forward to the leftover porridge more than the Thanksgiving meal itself.",

These cookies are of legend within our family, and not just because of how delicious they are, but because of the incredible woman who baked them. My grandmother was a wonderfully caring person who devoted her life to helping others as a nurse. She had an immense heart and a carefree spirit.

These cookies are nourishing, sweet, and delightful, just like her. They still bring us so much joy, and I hope they do the same for you!",

It was our chance to get out of the elements, take a break from farm chores, and joke around with each other as we ate. This beer bread recipe, brought to us by a friend of the family from Western Washington, was a well-loved wintertime staple — there was something about coming out of the cold and into a house that smelled like fresh bread that really soothed the soul. Sometimes we would make it in the summer too, bringing a few slices of bread, along with some cheese and apples, into the field as a harvest snack. No matter the season, this bread always helped nourish and replenish us after a long day's work. Though my life has changed significantly since leaving Eastern Washington, I don’t think I’ll ever be able to let this recipe — or the memories attached to it — go.",

      "RECIPE NOTES: This is a quick bread. You don't need to knead it, proof it, or any of that–just mix in a bowl with a spoon, plop it in a bread pan, and cook it. I highly recommend adding some spices (no more than a tablespoon total) to the batter to add a little flavor. A mix of rosemary, thyme, and oregano works great, or you can use herbs of provence if you're feeling fancy. This recipe adapts really well, so have fun with it! Add whatever spices you usually like to cook with and see if it works. You have the option to use a dark carbonated soda, such as coke or pepsi as a beer substitue; however, try to avoid sodas flavored with syrup, and instead use a cane-sugar soda like Mexican Coca-Cola, otherwise the texture will turn out funny.

Tea-time meant long talks about politics, The Depression, WWII, "the old country," homesteading in Saskatchewan, with the exclamation "Thank God Dad bought an orchard along the Kootenay, B.C.." No one wanted to go back, where the winter wind would whip across the prairie and slice your face. My father was the only one of ten kids, who came down to the States, during the Depression, to build the Grand Coulee Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge. His heart remained in Canada. My doting aunts baked tins full of goodies and advised me that husbands were good for "kneading the shortbread." Later, when I visited Scottish relatives, I found tea-time was much the same.',

    story:
      "Like most Jewish mothers, mine was short on praise. Instead, she showered me with the love she poured into baking cookies, breads, and casseroles crafted from her revolving twenty-pound bag of flour. Sunday breakfasts included delectable pastries, butter and sugar caramelized between dozens of layers folded by my mother’s own hands. I learned from her how to express my love, not through words, but by baking pies bursting with hand- picked berries. When I was diagnosed with cancer in 2013, I transformed my diet to eliminate milk, gluten, and refined sugars. Although my sweet tooth was not easy to tame, I set out to update some of my favorite recipes, like the French toast casserole my mother served when family came to visit. Today I am cancer-free and enjoy serving this version to friends at Sunday brunches, accompanied by seasonal salads inspired by weekly pilgrimages to PNW farmers’ markets.",

      "03 Cover and let sit in the fridge overnight. The bread will soak up all that eggy goodness, and you can spend the morning lazily sipping coffee instead of flipping bread on the griddle. ",
      "04 In a bowl, crumble butter, coconut sugar, cinnamon, and salt together with hands and then mix in walnuts. Sprinkle mix over the top of the casserole. Bake at 400°F for 30-40 minutes. Cook it until the top is a golden brown and the bottom layer is bubbly and still moist. Serve warm with maple syrup.",

    story:
      "Good food has always reminded me of home. Growing up, I would often walk into my parents’ house and be welcomed by cooking in the kitchen and by mouth-watering smells awaiting my senses. During special occasions, my mom would cook her infamous Challah bread. The smell of this homemade bread permeated our entire house and would draw my brother and I in front of the oven to watch the braided plaits bake. After it was done, I would often rip the bread apart instead of slicing it saying, “the bread is soft today”. Having this bread during a meal meant that we were celebrating not only a fruitful season of life, but that we could be in the same place at once, eating and sharing community with each other. One can enjoy this loaf of bread with butter and rosemary or roll the dough in cinnamon and sugar to enjoy a sweet trea         ",

      "01 First mix the yeast and honey with warm water in a 5-quart bowl, or in a lidded (not airtight) food container to start activation. Then, add in eggs, salt, and melted butter. ",
      "02 Mix in the flour without kneading, using a spoon, your hands, or a hand- mixer with a dough hook. ",
      "03 Cover (not airtight), and allow to rest at room temperature until the dough rises and collapses (or flattens on top), approximately 2 hours. ",
      "04 Butter or grease a cookie sheet or line with parchment paper. Dust the surface of the dough with flour and cut off a 1-pound (grapefruit-size) piece. Dust the piece with more flour and quickly shape it into a ball by stretching the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all four sides, rotating the ball a quarter-turn as you go. ",
      "05 Divide the ball into thirds, using a dough scraper or knife. Roll the balls between your hands (or on a board), stretching, to form each into a long, thin rope. If the dough resists shaping, let it rest for 5 minutes, and try again. Braid the ropes, starting from the center and working to one end. Turn the loaf over, rotate it, and braid from the center out to the remaining end. This produces a loaf with more uniform thickness than when braided from end to end. ",
      "06 Allow the bread to rest and rise on the prepared cookie sheet for 40 minutes. ",
      "07 20 minutes before baking time, preheat the oven to 350°F. Brush the loaf with egg wash. ",
      "08 Bake near the center of the oven for about 25 minutes. Smaller or larger loaves will require adjustments in baking time. The Challah is done when golden brown, and the braids near the center of the loaf offer resistance to pressure. Allow to cool before eating. Enjoy!",
